/**
 * A VirtualDisplaySurface2 provides a "surface" for compositing. Compositing to
 * this surface ultimately sends buffers to an application over the sinkSurface
 * provided at construction time.
 *
 * In addition to the lifecycle management for every frame provided by the implementation of
 * compositionengine::DisplaySurface, the compositor needs a Surface/ANativeWindow to actually
 * render to. This is provided by VirtualDisplaySurface2::getCompositionSurface.
 *
 * Virtual Display composition can happen in several different types (see CompositionType):
 *   - Hwc: All layers are composited in the HardwareComposer itself.
 *   - Gpu: All layers are composited on the GPU in CompositionEngine/RenderEngine.
 *   - Mixed: Some layers are composited on the GPU and are combined with others composited in
 *   HardwareComposer.
 *
 * Hwc compositing is pretty straightforward. An output buffer has to be set in HWC for rendering in
 * advanceFrame, which will be sent to the application with the present fence in onFrameCommitted.
 *
 * Gpu compositing is a little more complicated: CompositionEngine dequeues a buffer from the
 * composition surface, does all the composition on the GPU, and queues it. Then we take the buffer
 * and its fence out of the composition surface (in a SurfaceListener::onFrameAvailable callback)
 * and send it to the application.
 *
 * Mixed compositing is the most complicated. Both composition paths are taken, some number of
 * layers are composed on the GPU and provided to us by the composition surface. We set that in a
 * special field in HWC during advanceFrame. The output buffer and present fence are sent to the app
 * after the frame's committed to HWC.
 *
 * To manage buffers, we do a certain amount of "buffer juggling" to promote recycling and reuse.
 * There are three main BQs at play:
 *   - Sink BQ: A surface that is provided by the application at creation time. The purpose of a
 *   virtual display is do compositing and send buffers to the sink.
 *   - Render BQ: A surface that is provided to composition engine for GPU rendering.
 *   VirtualDisplaySurface2 owns the consumer. In Gpu, buffers are taken out of this queue and sent
 *   to the application.
 *   - Output BQ: A surface that is used to provide buffers for HWC outputs. VirtualDisplaySurface2
 *   owns both the surface and consumer. In Mixed and Hwc modes, buffers are taken out of this
 *   queue and sent to the application.
 *
 * We try to reuse buffers dequeued from the Sink BQ as often as possible to avoid having to send
 * new buffers over IPC to the application too frequently.
